enhancing this module for my Sitecore necesity 
by relying on the 404 page created for my project. Before giving the 404 error checks 
the type in the Uri. Based on the types configured in the XML 
it tries to redirect to the right place, 
if not then continues to the 404 error page.  

Feel free to use it. 

What was changed:
1. the XML where the exception rules are
2. the config file to add a setting for the location of the XML
3. RuleException.cs. Class which serves kind like a model for loading the XML to an object and cache it to use it in the URL-redirect model
4. URLRewriteHandler.cs. An update to add the logic to load the RuleExceptions
5. Settings.cs to add the new setting so it can be read from the config
6. DataRepository.cs. the only purpose is to read the XML and load it into the RuleExceptions object.

I'll probably do some refactoring, but again feel free to use it if it works for you and change it accordingly.

Thanks to ParTech for providing this sitecore Module, I hope this contribution is good for the project.
